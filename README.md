# burger

Summary: A node application that involves handlebars, controllers, and models for the UI. For the backend it has a MySQL database that stores the burgers that are eaten and uneaten. Whenever the user enters in a new burger or any other new food in the text box the new food will be stored in the left side of the panel. Also a button called "Eat It" will be shown next to the newly added food or burger. The new burger or food wil also be inserted into the burger database with the eaten value set to false. If the user clicks on the "Eat It" button the burger or food will go to the right side of the panel. Also the eaten value will be set to true.
